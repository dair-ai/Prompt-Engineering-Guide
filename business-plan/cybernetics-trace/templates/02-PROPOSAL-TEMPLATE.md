## Appendix: Frequently Asked Questions

**How much of our team's time will this require?**
Minimal. We'll need about 2-3 hours total from your team for interviews and access setup. The rest is on us.

**What access do you need?**
We'll need administrative access to your network, servers, and key applications. All access is documented and can be revoked immediately after the engagement.

**What if we already know what we need to fix?**
The assessment often reveals issues you didn't know about and opportunities you hadn't considered. Even if you have a good sense of the problems, having a documented, prioritized roadmap makes execution much more efficient.

**Is this a sales pitch for ongoing services?**
No strings attached. At the end, you'll have a complete roadmap you can execute yourself, hire freelancers to build, or engage us to implement. It's your choice.

**What makes this different from a "free assessment" from other IT companies?**
Free assessments are typically superficial and designed to find problems that sell their services. Our paid assessment is thorough, objective, and designed to give you real value regardless of what you do next.
