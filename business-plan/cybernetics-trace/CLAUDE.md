## Important Guidelines

### When Updating Documents

1. **Maintain Consistency**
   - Use the same terminology across all documents
   - "360° Systems & Security Trace" is the audit product name
   - "Fractional Architect" is the retainer positioning

2. **Preserve Formatting**
   - Documents use Markdown with tables, code blocks, and ASCII diagrams
   - Keep the visual hierarchy consistent

3. **Phase 1 Focus**
   - All content is optimized for the first 90 days
   - Don't add features or complexity beyond MVP scope
   - If it doesn't help close deals or deliver audits, it's out of scope

### Key Terminology

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Gateway Product | The low-risk entry engagement (the audit) |
| Fractional Architect | Positioning for the retainer service |
| 360° Trace | Shorthand for the full audit product |
| ICP | Ideal Client Profile |
| Discovery Call | 15-minute qualification conversation |

### Target Audience Personas

## Remember

> "If an activity doesn't fit on this map, don't do it in Phase 1. Focus wins. Discipline wins."

The entire business plan is optimized for one goal: **getting paying clients in the first 90 days.** Every document, template, and process serves that purpose.
