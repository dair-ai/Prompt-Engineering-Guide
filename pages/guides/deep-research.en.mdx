### What is Deep Research?

[Deep Research](https://openai.com/index/introducing-deep-research/) is OpenAI’s new agent that can perform **multi-step research** on the internet for performing complex tasks like generating reports and competitor analysis. 

* It has access to tools (Python) and the internet (browser tools).   
* It is powered by **OpenAI o3 model** which is optimized for web browsing and data analysis. It uses reasoning to search, interpret, and analyze massive amounts of information.   
* The model was trained using reinforcement learning (RL) to browse, reason about complex information, and learn to **plan and execute multi-step trajectories** to find the data it needs.   
* It can also **backtrack**, **adopts its plan**, and **react** to real-time information as it needs.   
* It supports **user-uploaded files**, **generates plots** (using Python), and embeds generated graphs and images from websites (not functional at the moment), including adding citations.

### How to decide when to use Deep Research?

Use Deep Research if the task **requires multi-faceted, domain-specific queries requiring extensive research for real-time information and careful reasoning/understanding** about that information. Look at other sections of this document for more concrete use cases and inspirations of when to use Deep Research. 

You can use the raw (without Deep Research) o1-mini and GPT-4o for all other tasks. Use o1-mini if it’s a task that can benefit from reasoning (breaking down complex tasks into smaller parts in an autonomous way). Use GPT-4o for all other one-off simple tasks.  

### How does Deep Research differ from other solutions? 

There are already dedicated agentic solutions (e.g., [Google Deep Research](https://blog.google/products/gemini/google-gemini-deep-research/)) and even frameworks to build agentic workflows like Deep Research.

For instance, you can use Flowise AI to replicate something similar (check out our AI Agents course for examples; more projects are coming soon). If you are a developer, you can use Llama Index, crewAI, or Langgraph to build these systems. They could be built for cheaper and integrated with the currently available o1 and o3-mini models. 

Note that OpenAI is using an o3 model variant (only they have access to) that has been specifically designed to conduct complex reasoning and multi-step research tasks. These are important capabilities for such workflows. It’s not entirely clear whether they are launching this model via the APIs or even ChatGPT. For comparison, look below at the results of Deep Research and o3-mini-high on [Humanity’s Last Exam](https://lastexam.ai/):

### Usage Tips for OpenAI’s Deep Research

Here is a summary of the usage tips I have gathered from my own experiments and observing the results of others:

* **More compute, better results:** The more you allow the model to browse and think, the better the performance  
    
* **Prompt Engineering**   
  * **Clear and specific instructions:** Give it a plan and make sure you are as specific as possible about it. The tasks take a while to complete so it’s important to get it right the first time.   
  * **Clarify, don’t ignore:** The model will ask questions to clarify certain parts it’s not clear about so this can help you be more specific on results. Spend as much time as you need to clarify to the models what exactly you want or missed initially. The requests are more expensive than standard queries so it’s important to get it right and not miss any details.       
  * **Keywords help a lot:** In the end, the reasoning model picks keywords to search the web, so provide as many keywords as possible. The more precise the terminology (e.g., brand, technical term, product name), the less time and effort the model has to spend to figure this out.   
  * **Use clear verbs:** Deep Research has been trained to follow instructions to better understand what is the ideal output you want. Use verbs like “compare”, “suggest”, “recommend”, and “report”, to help the model understand the main task at hand and what you are expecting as the output.  
  * **Output Format:** Provide instructions about the format you want, if any. For instance, what type of report, format, or sections to include, or if you need tables for any of the results. You can also be more specific about the layout of report or tables you are generating (e.g., how many columns, headers, etc.). The format the model prefers to output may not be accessible to all audiences (it prefers report-style outputs).   
  * **Upload files as context:** Add files such as PDFs to help guide the model and provide important context upfront. This could be useful when asking queries related to very technical and domain-specific topics or information that the model is highly likely not to have much knowledge of. This only works with the ChatGPT-4o model.  
      
* **Check sources & Verify information:** Make sure to check sources yourself. The model can still make mistakes and may struggle to distinguish authoritative information from speculative or rumours. 

### What to try?

These are some ideas that you can try using Deep Research for:

* **Research**  
  * Performing comprehensive market research/competitor analysis on AI tools  
  * Research around new products including reviews, price comparisons, etc.  
  * Give it a doc and ask it to augment and fill in more details or even critize it  
  * Do extensive research to make product feature recommendations based on trends, adoption rates, and other user patterns  
  * User studies  
  * Legal case research: gathering case laws, precedents, and regulations  
  * Fact-checking or background checks  
* **Business use cases**  
  * Search and develop AI/agent use cases for a specific domain  
  * Track trends in a specific domain or topic  
* **Learning use cases**  
  * Build a study plan and make recommendations about a learning path  
  * A collection of tips and coding best practices on how to use AI models  
  * Check for the latest features of a specific developer tool and ask it to suggest exercises or learning material  
* **Science**  
  * Latest research on health-related topics like sleep, symptoms, mental health, etc.   
  * Write technical reports with the latest findings about a topic  
* **Content Creation**  
  * Write a blog post on a combination of topics  
  * Suggest topics to write about or build content about by analyzing trends on the web about a domain  
* **Personal**   
  * Develop a detailed bio about you or any other public figure  
  * Develop/update a resume based on public information and projects  
  * Generate/Suggest slides for an upcoming presentation

### What’s missing/challenges? 

* Still struggles to synthesize technical information. It’s helpful to provide any supporting docs if available.    
* Still needs to improve on hallucinations. The model still make mistakes and may struggle to distinguish authoritative information from rumors  
* Results for different sectors/domains might vary.  
* Has challenges with combining diverse types of information.  
* Not clear how to make it explicitly search for more online sources (say like 50 different articles) or specific sources. We also noticed that it’s biased towards certain domain names.  
* Citation mistakes and formatting errors.  
* It’s difficult to get information out of deep research. It could be great to get features that allow exporting to other formats like excel, notebooks, notions, docs, or other popular editing software.   
* Not great with time/date-related queries; be as specific as you can here.  
* Sources behind paywalls/subscriptions are still not supported; integrations for this may be coming in the future.  
* Generating and embedding charts is not functional yet from our experiment. We believe this will be rolled out eventually.   
* Deep Research doesn’t take action (yet). OpenAI claims that Deep Research can open web pages and look at different components (mostly reading actions) but it might be interesting for it to perform site searches (in the background) and execute actions like Operator. This can help it find more relevant information across the web (e.g., use the advanced search functionality on the arXiv website). (Deep Research with site search capabilities)  
* More tools and accessing knowledge bases automatically would be interesting.  
* More personalization is needed in the outputs. Could potentially improve this by leveraging custom instructions (not sure how this affects responses yet).
