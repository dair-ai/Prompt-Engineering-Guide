# Mixtral 8x22B

Mixtral 8x22B is a new open large language model (LLM) released by Mistral AI. Mixtral 8x22B is characterized as a sparse mixture-of-experts model with 39B active parameters out of a total of 141B parameters. 

## Capabilities

Mixtral 8x22B is trained to be a cost-efficient model with capabilities that include multilingual understanding, math reasoning, code generation, native function calling support,  and constrained output support. The model supports a context window size of 64K tokens which enables high-performing information recall on large documents. 

Mistral AI claims that Mixtral 8x22B delivers one of the best performance-to-cost ratio community models and it is significantly fast due to its sparse activations.
