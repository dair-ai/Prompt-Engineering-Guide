These hands-on courses are built to compliment this prompt engineering guide. They are designed to help expand your skills and knowledge by teaching you how to effectively apply the concepts learned in this guide to real-world use cases and applications.

[Elvis Saravia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/omarsar/), who has worked at companies like Meta AI and Elastic, and has years of experience in AI and LLMs, is the instructor for both courses.

Our past learners range from software engineers to AI researchers and practitioners in organizations like Microsoft, Google, Apple, Airbnb, LinkedIn, Amazon, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Asana, Intuit, Fidelity Investments, Coinbase, Guru, and many others.
