In this section, we will cover some of the recent language models and how they successfully apply the latest and most advanced prompting engineering techniques. In addition, we cover capabilities of these models on a range of tasks and prompting setups like few-shot prompting, zero-shot prompting, and chain-of-thought prompting. Understanding these capabilities are important to understand the limitations of these models and how to use them effectively.
