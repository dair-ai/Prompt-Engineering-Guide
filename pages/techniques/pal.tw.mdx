[Gao 等人（2022）](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10435) 提出一種方法，讓大型語言模型（LLM）閱讀自然語言問題，並產生程式作為中間推理步驟。這種方法被稱為程式輔助語言模型（PAL）。它與思維鏈提示詞（chain-of-thought prompting）不同，因為不是用自由形式文字寫出解題過程，而是把解題步驟交給像 Python 直譯器這樣的程式執行環境處理。

讓我們以 LangChain 和 OpenAI GPT-3 為例。我們想開發一個簡單的應用程式，能讀懂使用者提問，並透過 Python 直譯器提供答案。

具體來說，我們希望建立一個功能，讓 LLM 透過撰寫與執行程式來回答需要理解日期的問題。我們會提供一個提示詞（prompt），其中包含幾個範例，部分內容改寫自這個 [專案](https://github.com/reasoning-machines/pal/blob/main/pal/prompt/date_understanding_prompt.py)。

以下是我們需要匯入的套件：

```python
import openai
from datetime import datetime
from dateutil.relativedelta import relativedelta
import os
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from dotenv import load_dotenv
```

首先，讓我們進行一些設定：

```python
load_dotenv()

# API 設定
openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

# 給 LangChain 使用
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
```

建立模型執行個體：

```python
llm = OpenAI(model_name='text-davinci-003', temperature=0)
```

設定提示詞與問題：

```python
question = "Today is 27 February 2023. I was born exactly 25 years ago. What is the date I was born in MM/DD/YYYY?"

DATE_UNDERSTANDING_PROMPT = """
# Q: 2015 is coming in 36 hours. What is the date one week from today in MM/DD/YYYY?
# If 2015 is coming in 36 hours, then today is 36 hours before.
today = datetime(2015, 1, 1) - relativedelta(hours=36)
# One week from today,
one_week_from_today = today + relativedelta(weeks=1)
# The answer formatted with %m/%d/%Y is
one_week_from_today.strftime('%m/%d/%Y')
# Q: The first day of 2019 is a Tuesday, and today is the first Monday of 2019. What is the date today in MM/DD/YYYY?
# If the first day of 2019 is a Tuesday, and today is the first Monday of 2019, then today is 6 days later.
today = datetime(2019, 1, 1) + relativedelta(days=6)
# The answer formatted with %m/%d/%Y is
today.strftime('%m/%d/%Y')
# Q: The concert was scheduled to be on 06/01/1943, but was delayed by one day to today. What is the date 10 days ago in MM/DD/YYYY?
# If the concert was scheduled to be on 06/01/1943, but was delayed by one day to today, then today is one day later.
today = datetime(1943, 6, 1) + relativedelta(days=1)
# 10 days ago,
ten_days_ago = today - relativedelta(days=10)
# The answer formatted with %m/%d/%Y is
ten_days_ago.strftime('%m/%d/%Y')
# Q: It is 4/19/1969 today. What is the date 24 hours later in MM/DD/YYYY?
# It is 4/19/1969 today.
today = datetime(1969, 4, 19)
# 24 hours later,
later = today + relativedelta(hours=24)
# The answer formatted with %m/%d/%Y is
today.strftime('%m/%d/%Y')
# Q: Jane thought today is 3/11/2002, but today is in fact Mar 12, which is 1 day later. What is the date 24 hours later in MM/DD/YYYY?
# If Jane thought today is 3/11/2002, but today is in fact Mar 12, then today is 3/12/2002.
today = datetime(2002, 3, 12)
# 24 hours later,
later = today + relativedelta(hours=24)
# The answer formatted with %m/%d/%Y is
later.strftime('%m/%d/%Y')
# Q: Jane was born on the last day of Feburary in 2001. Today is her 16-year-old birthday. What is the date yesterday in MM/DD/YYYY?
# If Jane was born on the last day of Feburary in 2001 and today is her 16-year-old birthday, then today is 16 years later.
today = datetime(2001, 2, 28) + relativedelta(years=16)
# Yesterday,
yesterday = today - relativedelta(days=1)
# The answer formatted with %m/%d/%Y is
yesterday.strftime('%m/%d/%Y')
# Q: {question}
""".strip() + '\n'
```

```python
llm_out = llm(DATE_UNDERSTANDING_PROMPT.format(question=question))
print(llm_out)
```

輸出會類似：
```
# If today is 27 February 2023 and I was born exactly 25 years ago, then I was born 25 years before.
today = datetime(2023, 2, 27)
# I was born 25 years before,
born = today - relativedelta(years=25)
# The answer formatted with %m/%d/%Y is
born.strftime('%m/%d/%Y')
```

`llm_out` 的內容是一段 Python 程式碼，我們可以用 `exec` 來執行它：

```python
exec(llm_out)
print(born)
```

這會輸出：`02/27/1998`
