## 背景
以下提示詞用來測試 LLM 的資訊擷取能力，任務是從機器學習論文摘要中擷取模型名稱。

## 提示詞

```markdown
Your task is to extract model names from machine learning paper abstracts. Your response is an array of the model names in the format [\"model_name\"]. If you don't find model names in the abstract or you are not sure, return [\"NA\"]

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, have revolutionized natural language processing research and demonstrated potential in Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). However, the expensive training and deployment of LLMs present challenges to transparent and open academic research. To address these issues, this project open-sources the Chinese LLaMA and Alpaca…
