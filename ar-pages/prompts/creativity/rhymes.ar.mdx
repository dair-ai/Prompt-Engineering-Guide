# Rhyming with Proofs

import { Tabs, Tab } from 'nextra/components'

## Background
This prompt tests an LLM's natural language and creative capabilities by prompting it to write a proof of infinitude of primes in the form of a poem.

## Prompt
```
Can you write a proof that there are infinitely many primes, with every line that rhymes?
```
