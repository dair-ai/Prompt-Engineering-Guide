We've partnered with Maven to deliver the following live cohort-based courses on prompt engineering:

- [LLMs for Everyone ](https://maven.com/dair-ai/llms-for-everyone) (Beginner) - learn about the latest prompt engineering techniques and how to effectively apply them to real-world use cases.

- [Prompt Engineering for LLMs ](https://maven.com/dair-ai/prompt-engineering-llms) (Advanced) - learn advanced prompt engineering techniques to build complex use cases and applications with LLMs.

We are now offering a special discount for our learners. Use promo code MAVENAI20 for a 20% discount.
