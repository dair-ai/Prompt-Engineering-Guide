## What's new?

This paper introduces a collection of foundation language models ranging from 7B to 65B parameters. 

The models are trained on trillion of tokens with publicly available datasets.

The work by [(Hoffman et al. 2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15556) shows that given a compute budget smaller models trained on a lot more data can achieve better performance than the larger counterparts. This work recommends training 10B models on 200B tokens. However, the LLaMA paper finds that the performance of a 7B model continues to improve even after 1T tokens.

This work focuses on training models (LLaMA) that achieve the best possible performance at various inference budgets, by training on more tokens. 


## Capabilities & Key Results

Overall, LLaMA-13B outperform GPT-3(175B) on many benchmarks despite being 10x smaller and possible to run a single GPU. LLaMA 65B is competitive with models like Chinchilla-70B and PaLM-540B.
